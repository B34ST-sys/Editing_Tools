# Editing_Tools
Here I present multiple editing software tools that I programmed and do not require external sites or applications to utilize. Any tool uploaded here is able to be run on a terminal and utilized effectively and efficiently.

Each tool will have its own README file down below that I recommend you take alook at before implementing and attemtping to utilize said tool. Each README comes with both instructions and information on how the tool works so you have a better understanding of it as you use it for your editing purposes.

Enjoy using these exciting and simple to operate image and video editing tools!
Cheers and happy editing!
